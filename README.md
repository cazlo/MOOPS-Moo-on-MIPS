CS3340-Bulls-Hit-Project
========================

Bulls and Cows game for CS3340 Computer Architecture class project

##About the Game

The game is a 2 player code breaking game.
The first player randomly comes up with a hexadecimal number composed of 4 unique numbers.
The second player then tries to guess the number.
The first player tells the second player how many bulls (matching number at the correct position) and cows (matching numbers in the incorrect position) there are.
If the second player guesses the number within a set amount of tries, they win.

###Possible Future Additions
1. Add ability to play again.  Keep score and see how badly you can beat the AI.
2. Extend MARS through its tool interface, allowing a GUI for the program.
  Doing this opens up the ability to add a timer, as well as playback of a cow moo's, rather than sticking to MIDI for sound output.
